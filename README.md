üîç Overview
Financial fraud poses a significant threat to businesses and consumers worldwide, with global losses projected to reach $43 billion in the next five years. This project leverages XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting), a powerful ensemble learning algorithm, to detect fraudulent transactions by analyzing behavioral patterns and transaction anomalies.‚Äã

The model addresses the critical challenge of class imbalance (fraud cases are typically <1% of all transactions) and achieves a balance between precision and recall to ensure both fraud detection accuracy and minimal disruption to legitimate customers.‚Äã

Key Objectives
Detect fraudulent transactions in real-time with high precision

Minimize false positives to avoid blocking legitimate customers

Handle extremely imbalanced datasets effectively

Provide interpretable results for fraud investigation teams

‚ú® Features
XGBoost Classifier: State-of-the-art gradient boosting algorithm optimized for fraud detection‚Äã

Class Imbalance Handling: Implements SMOTE, undersampling, and scale_pos_weight tuning‚Äã

Feature Engineering: Creates transaction pattern features, time-based aggregations, and behavioral indicators

Hyperparameter Optimization: Grid search and cross-validation for optimal model performance‚Äã

Anomaly Detection: Identifies unusual transaction patterns that deviate from normal behavior‚Äã

Threshold Tuning: Adjustable classification thresholds (0.5 to 0.9) to balance precision and recall‚Äã

Real-time Prediction: Capable of flagging fraudulent transactions as they occur‚Äã

Model Interpretability: Feature importance analysis and SHAP values for decision transparency‚Äã

ü§ñ Model Architecture
XGBoost Overview
XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) is an ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees sequentially, where each tree corrects the errors of previous ones.‚Äã

Key Advantages for Fraud Detection:

Handles Imbalanced Data: scale_pos_weight parameter adjusts for class imbalance‚Äã

Regularization: Built-in L1/L2 regularization prevents overfitting

Feature Importance: Identifies which features contribute most to fraud detection‚Äã

Speed: Highly optimized for fast training and prediction‚Äã

Robustness: Resistant to outliers and noisy data

Hyperparameters
Optimized hyperparameters through grid search:‚Äã
